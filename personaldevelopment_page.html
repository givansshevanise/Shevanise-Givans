            I’m thankful for being introduced to the book “Twelve Pillars” by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener. <br>After reading Chapters 4–7, here are my main takeaways:

        <fieldset><center><h3>Achieve Your Goals</h3> <br></center>
            <center><img src="..//Assets/goals.png" height="600px" width="1000"></center>
            <p>
             <font size = "4">I learned that your current situation is a direct reflection of your goals. 
                 If you lack clear objectives, it’s no wonder you feel lost. The chapter emphasizes the importance of writing down your goals, starting with a list of 100 things you want to accomplish before you die. 
                 This exercise not only sparks your imagination but also helps you subconsciously devise ways to achieve these goals, making the process feel more attainable. 
                 Additionally, categorizing your goals into different areas of your life promotes balanced growth and development, ensuring that you’re nurturing all aspects of yourself, from personal to professional. 
                 Ultimately, this structured approach fosters a sense of purpose and direction, guiding you toward a more fulfilling life. 
                 By regularly reviewing and adjusting your goals, you can stay aligned with your evolving aspirations.</font>   </p><br>

                <center><p><font size = "4">
                    In line with the chapter on achieving your goals, here are 4 exciting goals I’ve set to complete by December:
                    <br>
                    1. Learn Norwegian (A1 Level), 
                    2. Create one new piece of art (painting, crochet, etc.), 
                    3. Explore different hobbies, 
                    4. Read 4 books.
                    <br><br>
                    I would love to hear your goals too! Feel free to share them with me at 
                    <a href="mailto:shevanisegivans44@gmail.com?subject= These are my goals">shevanisegivans44@gmail.com</a>.</font>

             <center><h3>The Proper Use of Time</h3></center>
             <center><img src="..//Assets/time.jpg.webp" height="600px" width="1000"></center>
             <p>
                <font size = "4">I learned that effective time management often sees people focusing on urgent tasks rather than what truly matters, which can lead to stagnation in their lives.
                  A significant wake-up call was the reminder that if you don’t plan your day, someone else will end up doing it for you, leaving you to work toward their goals instead of your own. 
                  The chapter emphasizes the importance of prioritizing tasks that align with your long-term objectives and setting aside time for reflection and planning. 
                  By creating a structured schedule and dedicating time to important activities, 
                  you can reclaim control over your life and ensure that each day contributes to your personal growth. Ultimately, mastering time management is about making conscious choices that reflect your values and aspirations, 
                  leading to a more purposeful and fulfilling life.</font></p><br>
     
             <center><h3>Surround Yourself With the Best People</h3></center>
             <center><img src="..//Assets/friends.webp" height="600px" width="1000"></center>
             <p> <font size = "4">I found the message particularly personal, as I’ve been struggling to build the right community around me. 
                 The chapter highlights how the people you surround yourself with significantly influence your growth and outlook on life. While it can be challenging to let go of certain relationships, 
                 doing so opens up space for connections that truly uplift and inspire you. With this insight, I will be more intentional about who I engage with at a deeper level, 
                 recognizing that positive influences can propel me toward my goals. 
                 Ultimately, cultivating a supportive network is essential for fostering both personal and professional development.</font></p><br>
     
             <center><h3>Be A Lifelong Learner</h3></center>
             <center><img src="..//Assets/learning.jpg" height="600px" width="1000"></center>
     
             <p> <font size = "4">I felt a powerful reinforcement of the principles I’ve been implementing in my life over the years, which helped me realign with my goals. 
                 One of my aspirations for 2024 was to read 12 books, but I had fallen off track, making this chapter a timely wake-up call. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that several of the books on my to-read list were also mentioned in the chapter, 
                 inspiring me to prioritize them. The chapter emphasized a crucial point: that traditional education—whether in university, college, or school—doesn't cover everything you need to know. To truly grow, you must venture out, explore, and test your ideas while observing the world around you to 
                 acquire the qualities that are essential for success. 
                 Embracing a mindset of lifelong learning is key to unlocking your full potential.</font></p>

                I’m continuing my learning journey by trying a new language and experimenting with my fashion. I’m also exploring my interests in random topics like clouds. 
                <br><br>
                Are you continuing to learn and explore new interests? I’d love to hear about your experiences! Feel free to share your goals with me at

    <p><font size = "4">
    I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor in Computing, which is setting a solid foundation for my future as a software engineer. One of the key skills I’ve developed so far is time management. While I'm not an expert yet,
    I’ve learned that maintaining a balance between my academic, mental, and physical health requires careful planning of my days. Working by deadlines is crucial, as it mirrors the expectations I will face in my future career. 
    In the real world, being late can result in missed opportunities, so mastering this skill now will help me succeed in both my studies and my professional life. By prioritizing effective time management, 
    I’m better equipped to handle the demands of my degree and future job.
    </p></font><br>

    <p><font size = "4">
    Another essential skill I’ve gained is teamwork. Initially, I found collaborating with others challenging, and I still encounter difficulties at times. However, learning how to communicate effectively has been incredibly helpful, allowing our work to flow more smoothly. 
    Building valuable connections with my peers not only enhances our projects but also enriches my learning experience. 
    Embracing different perspectives within a team has taught me the importance of collaboration and adaptability, 
    which are crucial in the tech industry.
    </p></font><br>

    <p><font size = "4">
    Lastly, I’ve learned to be thankful for the hard times.
    It’s easy to overlook how fortunate we are when everything seems to be going well. For instance, when I can’t get three hours of sleep due to poor time management, 
    I remind myself that it’s a valuable lesson to pay attention next time. These challenges foster resilience and encourage me to develop better habits. By appreciating the struggle, I can better recognize the importance of self-discipline and growth, 
    ultimately leading to a more fulfilling academic journey.
